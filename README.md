# vLLM-ATOM Trace Parser
Parse vLLM profiler traces to extract per-layer GPU kernel breakdowns.

## Important 
Please set **`VLLM_CUSTOM_SCOPES_FOR_PROFILING=1`** when capturing vLLM traces.

## Requirements
```bash
pip install openpyxl ijson # ijson is optional, used to reduce peak memory
```

## Usage
```bash
python parse_vllm_trace.py [options]
```
Traces must be captured with `VLLM_CUSTOM_SCOPES_FOR_PROFILING=1` to include the user annotation markers the parser relies on.
| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--layer N` | `8` | The transformer layer index to extract stats from |
| `--percentile P` | `50` | Use the P-percentile batches to obtain breakdown |
| `--eager-trace PATH` | - | Companion eager trace for extracting host module attributes. For graph-captured batches like decode workloads in `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` settings, kernel executions in a graph are packed into a single graph replay event, losing per-kernel CPU attribution. An eager trace can be provided to establish device-side kernels with the host-side kernel launches. |
| `--output-prefix PREFIX` | - | Prefix for the output xlsx filename. The output file will be "{PREFIX}_trace_breakdown.xlsx" |
